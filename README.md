# Sink OS

Sink OS is a browser-based operating system developed as part of an academic project. It is intended for educational and experimental use only. Sink OS is not designed for personal, commercial, or enterprise deployment unless explicitly authorized by the developer.

## Project Scope

Sink OS explores alternative approaches to browser-native operating systems. It is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and simulates a desktop-like environment within the browser.

This project is part of a school-based initiative and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any commercial entity.

## Intended Use

- Educational demonstration of browser-based UI/UX design
- Technical exploration of taskbar emulation, app launching, and emergency redirect protocols
- Comparative analysis with existing browser OS platforms such as Chrome OS and Puter

## Limitations

- Sink OS is not optimized for performance, security, or scalability in production environments
- No backend integration or persistent data storage is included
- Emergency features and redirects are implemented for demonstration purposes only

## Competitive Context

Sink OS is conceptually positioned as a lightweight alternative to Chrome OS and Puter, focusing on:

- Front-end emulation of operating system behavior
- Customizable UI elements and taskbar interactions
- Experimental features such as invisible emergency triggers and redirect zones

## License and Distribution

This project is distributed for educational purposes. Redistribution, modification, or deployment for personal or enterprise use requires explicit permission from the developer.

## Contact

For inquiries, permissions, or collaboration requests, please contact the developer directly.
